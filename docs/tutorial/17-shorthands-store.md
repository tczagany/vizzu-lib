## Shorthands & Store

To assist you with the development we added various shorthands that will make 
your code more compact. 

We also added store functions, which enable you to save either a chart state 
or a whole animation into a variable that you can reuse later instead of setting 
up that state or animation once again.

If you don't use the data and style properties in the first parameter of the animate method, you can simplify your code by using only the object of the config property.

```javascript { "title": "When only the config property is used" }
chart.animate({
// config: {
	align:'stretch'
// }
})
```

Let's save this state by calling the store function. 

```javascript { "pure": true, "run": false }
var snapshot;
```

```javascript { "title": "Store function" }
snapshot = chart.store();
```

If you set/attach/detach just one series on a channel, you don't have to put that series into an array.
Also, let's save this animation by calling the store method of the animation control object. 

```javascript { "pure": true, "run": false }
var animation;
```

```javascript { "title": "When just one series is used" }
chart.animate({
	channels: {
		// x: { attach: [ 'Kinds' ] },
		x: { attach: 'Kinds' },
		y: { detach: 'Kinds' }
	},
	align: 'none'
}).activated.then(control => { animation = control.store(); });
```

If you use set on a channel and no other options like range, you don't have to express that channel as an object. If you only set one series on a channel you can simply write the series' name after the channel name.

```javascript { "title": "When you use set and no other channel options" }
chart.animate({
	channels: {
		// y: { set: [ 'Kinds', 'Popularity' ] },
		y: [ 'Kinds', 'Popularity' ],
		x: 'Genres'
	}
})
```

In any case, you can simply omit the channel object, Vizzu will automatically recognize the channels by their names.

```javascript { "title": "You don't have to use the channel object" }
chart.animate({
// channels: {
	y: 'Kinds',
	x: ['Genres','Popularity']
// }
})
```

If you have multiple keyframes, but with no animation options,
you can omit the keyframe object.

```javascript { "title": "You don't have to use the keyframe object" }
chart.animate([
	{
//		target: {
		y: ['Genres','Popularity']
		x: 'Kinds',
//		}
	},{
//		target: {
		y: 'Kinds',
		x: ['Genres','Popularity']
//		}
	}
])
```

Instead of creating nested objects, you can set the styles like this.

```javascript { "title": "Shorthand for styles" }
chart.animate({
	style: { 
		// plot: { xAxis: { label: { fontSize: '150%' } } }
		'plot.xAxis.label.fontSize': '150%',
		'title.backgroundColor': '#A0A0A0'  
	}
})
```

This is how you can reuse a previously stored animation.

```javascript { "title": "Restoring a previously stored state" }
chart.animate(animation)
```

You can also get back to a state that you previously stored.

```javascript { "title": "Restoring a previously stored state" }
chart.animate(snapshot)
```
